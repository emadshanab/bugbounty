Description
-----------
A vulnerability has been discovered that affects the session-handling in the
Router Web Interface. An attacker could gain temporary admin access in a third
party customer router.

Product
-------
Swisscom Centro Grande v2 Router (ARRIS/Motorola) which have the remote access
function activated (deactivated by default).

Vulnerability
-------------
The flaw relates to the handling of the Anti-CSRF Nonce, which is not verified
correctly and allows an attacker to have remote admin access to management functions
that are normally reserved for the router owner. However, the router owner must
have the "remote access" option activated, must be logged in the router interface
and must visit a special crafted website, all at the same time. The vulnerability
has been tested and is confirmed.

Remediation
-----------
The remote access function has been deactivated on all routers. Router-owners who
still want to use this feature have been briefed. In regards to the attack
complexity and the reduced impact (due to mitigation) it is not planned to roll-out
a new firmware in a nearly future.
