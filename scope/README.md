# Swisscom Bug Bounty Program Scope

In principle, any Swisscom-owned assets are intended to be in scope of the
Program. This includes virtually all networks, systems, applications, products,
or services for which Swisscom holds operational responsibility.  

Likewise, assets from affiliated companies are also in scope if Swisscom AG
owns more than 50% of the company shares. You can find a list of such
participations in the annual reports under "Group Companies". However certain
exceptions apply, for example Fastweb S.p.A. is explicitly out of scope. 

Swisscom's customer systems or customer systems outsourced to Swisscom are
explicitly out of scope. 

A non-exhaustive list of assets is maintained here as authoritative source of
the program scope: https://github.com/swisscom/bugbounty/scope. Program
participants must ensure to restrict their research and testing activities with
regard to the scope defined in the IN-SCOPE and OUT-OF-SCOPE lists. Note that
items in the OUT-OF-SCOPE list take precedence over the IN-SCOPE items. Testing
on non-declared or OUT-OF-SCOPE assets will be viewed as a violation of the
Program Rules and any related report will be disregarded. In case a Swisscom
asset is missing from the list, please contact the Bug Bounty team to validate
and extend the scope accordingly.
