# Swisscom Bug Bounty Programme Scope
In principle, any Swisscom-owned assets are intended to be within the 
scope of the Programme. This includes almost all networks, systems, 
applications, products or services for which Swisscom is accountable. 

Likewise, assets from affiliated companies are also in scope if Swisscom 
Ltd owns more than 50% of the company shares. You can find a list of 
such participations in the current [annual 
report](https://reports.swisscom.ch/) under *Group Companies*. However, 
certain exceptions apply; for example, [Fastweb 
SpA](https://www.fastweb.it/) is explicitly out of scope. 

Swisscom's customer systems or customer systems outsourced to Swisscom 
are explicitly out of scope. 

A non-exhaustive list of assets is maintained here as an authoritative 
source of the programme scope. Participants must ensure to restrict 
their research and testing activities as defined in the *in-scope* and 
*out-of-scope* lists. Note that items in the *out-of-scope* list take 
precedence over the *in-scope* items. Testing on non-declared or 
*out-of-scope* assets will be viewed as a violation of the Programme 
Rules and any report on such will be disregarded. If a Swisscom asset is 
missing from the list, please contact the Bug Bounty team to validate 
and extend the scope accordingly.
