# Swisscom Bug Bounty Program - OUT-OF-SCOPE Assets
#
# In principle, any Swisscom-owned assets are intended to be in scope of the
# Program. This includes virtually all networks, systems, applications,
# products, or services for which Swisscom holds operational responsibility.
#
# Likewise, assets from affiliated companies are also in scope if Swisscom AG
# owns more than 50% of the company shares (exceptions may apply).
#
# Swisscom's customer systems or customer systems outsourced to Swisscom are
# explicitly out of scope.
#
# The following enumeration is a non-exhaustive list of OUT-OF-SCOPE assets.
# Program participants must ensure to restrict their research and testing
# activities with regard to the scope defined in the IN-SCOPE and OUT-OF-SCOPE
# lists. Note that items in the OUT-OF-SCOPE list take precedence over the
# IN-SCOPE items. Testing on non-declared or OUT-OF-SCOPE assets will be viewed
# as a violation of the Program Rules and any related report will be disregarded.
# In case a Swisscom asset is missing from the list, please contact the Bug
# Bounty team to validate and extend the scope accordingly.
